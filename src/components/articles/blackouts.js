        'So I left the girls in Paraty after a hilarious blackout that left us out in the streets in the absolute pitch black, you couldn’t see a thing, not a thing and stumbling back to the hostel in the torrential downpour with only our voices to mark our positions was funnier than you would think and scarier than I would have imagined. I hated to leave the girls but I had to stick to my own plan (which was not exactly in existence but slowly forming and heading in an opposite direction). So I headed off to Trindade, a paradise that had been recommended to me by a lovely guy I met in Rio, but unmentioned in guidebooks. There were two foibles in my plan, firstly the torrential rain that was currently wiping out access to roads and power and secondly the national holiday which meant there were a million brazilians heading to the very same tiny spot. I arrived dripping wet and experiencing the well known extreme sport of backpack carrying whilst wearing flipflops in the pouring rain…lethal. After a few costly wrong turns that allowed me to witness first hand the sheer number of partying brazilians in this tiny town, I stumbled upon my hostel, a beautiful wooden house at the base of the tropical mountains. Even in the rain it was clear that this was an idyllic spot and I settled in, all a bit damp, a bit tired and a bit depressed. It’s always hard when you have had such a great time to leave the people you become so comfortable with, to get back on the road towards the unknown, just hoping that you meet a good crew….but that’s exactly what I did. It’s a small hostel so it’s a tight crew, a nice mix of nationalities and ages which made for entertaining nights and days',
        //para2[1]
        'One such night (afternoon) involved a shopping list which I have never before encountered, it included 72 limes and a big bag of ice which cost three times the amount of the alcohol cachaça it was to be mixed with. There is only one way these ingredients which equals a vat of caipirinha and a 5pm start is going to end …..blackout. But this wasn’t the only one we would experience and as the rain continued the power died and we were left in candle light praying our kindle and iPod batteries would hold out. 4 days without Internet feels like a lifetime, it really is a sorry state of affairs. I donned my rain gear and headed out trying not to let the weather spoil things, I am English after all. I am also the owner of a ridiculously over active imagination and as I started to hike down a steep path which was quickly turning into a muddy waterfall all I could think about was me in a scene from Romancing the Stone (showing my age) or The Goonies (still showing my age) or Indiana Jones (……..) and although I tried to keep going I had no option but to turn back retrace my slippery steps uphill and return to the hostel.',
        //para3[2]
        'The good news was that things were about to change and unluckily for the Brazilians it was the day that they were all heading back to the city for work that the sun won the battle and glorious blue skies, warm breezes and calmer seas  graced our presence. Trindade is amazing but even more so in good weather. You have to work for all good things out here and if you can hop skip and jump your way around you can find the most stunning beaches without a single footprint, the most icy clear rock pools, and the most heavenly waterfalls.',
        //para4[3]
        'In doing all of this I have become quickly aware that I am definitely no rock climber. As my lovely Dutch/Chilean/kiwi friend aka Jungle Boy flys through the jungle like a graceful gazelle, I lumber behind like an elephant. Still I manage and after a few days we take a trek to Ponte Negro a beautiful tiny village in a small bay on the coast. We pack a small bag and begin our trek, my inexperience is demonstrated by my choice of footwear-trainers, others go barefoot or in flip flops. This means every time we hit water I have to remove and replace footwear…annoying. Anyway it’s a great hike, we hike up mountains over rocks and through water and in such heat, it’s a good workout and our first break Sona beach makes me realise I could have walked 4 days just to see it. It’s breathtaking, what seems like miles of untouched sand stretching out before us, the cool sea calling us in. We take a quick dip to cool off and a quick drink before we head off again over another mountain, up a ridiculously steep muddy track to the waterfall. The water here is colder than the sea and while others throw themselves off rocks I take a dip and a minute to try to take it all in.',
        //para5[4]
        'After a further trek we reach another glorious beach, only us on it and we have a couple of hours to soak up the sun. I have to pinch myself sometimes to check if this is real, it all seems too amazing, all of this to be within my grasp. As I lay there on this paradise like beach in the warm sunshine I think about what led me to this point right now and I realise that none of that matters, what matters is that I am here in this moment of pure contentment, and I am sharing it with the loveliest, kindest, funniest people, as clear as the sea before me I realise I am truly truly happy. After a few of the group have thrown themselves off a stupidly high rock into the sea (I opted out-sorry Jez) we head off on our last section of the trek and finally catch a glimpse of our destination Ponte Negro. It’s beautiful, a village nestled into the mountain in a bay of calm sea. We are shown to our lodgings a lovely little chalet complete with hammock and after a quick refresh head down to dinner. There is no electricity here so we really feel away from it all. There are no other tourists, just the locals and us. They open the restaurant just for us. Dinner by candlelight on the beach, just the sound of the ocean and us laughing and talking as the drink flows and the most delicious fish, rice, beans and salad just keeps on coming. We can barely move but the locals light a bamboo fire for us so we practically roll ourselves to the beach and gather round the fire, beer in hand. It’s been a long day and after a while of relaxing by the warm fire with the locals, we head back up to our chalet in the pitch black with our torch to guide the way, we make it ok although I heard others took some very wrong turns. On return we realised we had been locked out by our buddies but fortunately managed to break in through the window, you can take the girl out of Leicester...',
        //para4[5]
        'We woke up to more gorgeous food but the weather was a bit shitty so we milled around a bit, slept a bit then ate a whole lot more before getting 3 fishing boats back to Trindade. This obviously turned into a race and my competitiveness almost had me rowing but we came in last….grrrrrr.',
        //para5[6]
        'I really really really did not want to leave Trindade, I had spent a week there, in this tiny town but it was not enough, I didn’t want it to end. As always though it isn’t just the place it’s the people and all my lovely friends were heading off and the thought of being there without them was too horrible. I dragged myself out of bed yesterday morning and with 3 of my buddies hit the road……Next stop Iguassu Falls, bring it on.'
